# Contributing to {project_name}

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. It is really helpful!
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the repo. They are not hard rules.

There is mainly three ways to contribute:

1.  Open issues to report bugs or make features requests
1.  Source code contributions (pull requests)
1.  (Translations contributions)
1.  Financial contributions

## Opening an issue

1. Please first check if your issue doesn't exist already. **Don't duplicate issues**!
1. If you reports a bug, please provide the more informations and **context** as possible. At least provide:
   - A **quick summary**, in "humans terms"
   - A guide to **reproduce the bug**. This can be a small code sample that will reproduce the problem. **Don't provide any confidential informations**. (Address, tokens, billing infos...)
   - Tell what **you expected to happen**, in case the "bug" is intentional.
   - Tell what **actually happen**, describing with precision what is happening (error messages, etc..)
   - Give additional informations, like your **environnement** (language version, lib version, OS, etc...)

## Source code contribution

You can look for opened issues and try to fix some bug, or to add some requested features.  
Except if you are sure of the importance of your PR, please try open an issue first if you want to make a contribution. It would be a pity if your PR is rejected because it isn't something we had planned.

Make precise PR, that focus on a single aspect.  
Try to follow the project style and conventions. You can use {explanations about code formatting}.

### Git commit guidelines

- Use present tense (e.g. "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Limit all lines to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues or pull requests outside of the first line.
  - Please use the shorthand `#123` and not the full URL.

If you do not meet any of these guidelines, don't fret. Chances are they will be fixed upon rebasing but please do try to meet them to remove some of the workload.
